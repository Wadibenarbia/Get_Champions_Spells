### If you Want to run this script for you, you first need to install python 2.7 

<pre> sudo apt-get install python </pre>

it's not working with python 3 because of the "print" syntaxe.


### Install pip: 

<pre> sudo apt-get install python-pip </pre>

### and install selenium 

<pre>  sudo pip install selenium </pre>

## DO NOT UPDATE PIP AS IT SAID it's currently full of bug so just keep pip 8

save and run "python spell_champion.py"

wait a bit and boom it work
